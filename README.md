# Pair Up
Hack Reactor juniors need to find a partner every time there’s a new sprint. Sometimes it’s hard to find a partner. It might seem like “everyone” is taken. That's where Pair Up comes in. 
Pair Up displays the list of students, and shows who’s looking for a partner. That way, students don’t need to ask 20 people before finding a someone. If a student doesn’t know who to pair with, Pair Up can randomly assign a partner.
